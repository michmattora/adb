# Monitor Your Autonomous Database Instance using the Cloud Console

## Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the monitoring capabilities available for your Autonomous Database (ADB).

Oracle provides several facilities for monitoring the performance and activity of your autonomous database. Among them are:
-   **Autonomous Database Metrics** (at bottom of Autonomous Database Details page)
-   **Database Actions - Database Dashboard** (accessible from Database Actions Launchpad)
-   **Performance Hub** (accessible on Autonomous Database Details page or from Database Actions Launchpad)
-   **OCI Monitoring Console** (targeted to cloud administrators and business users)

This lab covers how to monitor an autonomous database using the Autonomous Database Metrics, Database Dashboard, Performance Hub, and the OCI Monitoring Console.

The ADB user interface provides dashboards to monitor the real-time and historical CPU and storage utilization, as well as database activity, like the number of running or queued statements. It also provides Real-Time SQL Monitoring to look at current and past long-running SQL statements in your instance and allows you to cancel long-running queries or set thresholds for ADW or ATP to automatically cancel them for you.

## Task 1: Examine Database Metrics

The first facility that we will look at for monitoring your autonomous database is the Database Metrics display located conveniently at the bottom of the Database Details page.

1. In your ADW\_Finance\_Mart **Database Details** page, scroll down to the **Metrics** section.

    ![Scroll down to Metrics](images/scroll-down-to-metrics.png " ")

## Task 2: View All Database Metrics
The Metrics section displays an initial set of 6 graphs to examine database metrics. There are links to drill down to many additional graphs.

1. Scroll through the 8 initial graphs: CPU Utilization, Storage Utilization, Sessions, Execute Count, Running Statements, Queued Statements, Database Availability, and Failed Connections. The time period displayed on the metrics screen can also be easily changed to reflect your desired time period.

    ![Scroll down to Metrics eight initial graphs](images/scroll-down-to-metrics-eight-initial-graphs.png " ")

2. Click the **View all database metrics** link to examine many additional graphs of database metrics: Transaction Count, Current Logons, User Calls, Parse Count, Failed Logons, Failed Connections, Connection Latency, Query Latency, CPU Time, User Commits, User Rollbacks, Redo Size, Session Logical Reads, DB Block Changes, Physical Reads, Physical Writes, Physical Read Total Bytes, Physical Write Total Bytes, Parse Count (Hard), Parse Count (Failures), Bytes Received via SQL\*Net from DBLink, Bytes Sent via SQL\*Net to DBLink, Bytes Received via SQL\*Net from Client, Bytes Sent via SQL\*Net to Client, APEX Page Events, and APEX Page Load Time.

    ![Click View all database metrics](images/click-view-all-database-metrics.png " ")

## Task 3: Examine the Database Actions Database Dashboard
You can also view this information with more detailed tools provided in the Database Actions Launchpad.

1. Go back to your ADW\_Finance\_Mart database's **Autonomous Database details** page, and click the **Database actions** button. The sign-in page opens for Database Actions. For this lab, simply use your database instance's default administrator account, Username - **admin**, and click **Next**. Enter the admin password you specified when creating the database. Click **Sign in**. The **Database Actions Launchpad** opens. In the **Monitoring** section, click **Database Dashboard**.

    ![In Database Actions Launchpad Monitoring section click Database Dashboard](images/click-database-dashboard.png " ")

2. Examine the components of the Activity page: Database Activity, CPU Utilization, Running Statements, Queued Statements.

    ![](images/examine-activity-page.jpg " ")

3. To see earlier data, click **Time period**. The default retention period for performance data is eight days. So, this view shows information about the last eight days by default.

    ![](images/click-time-period.jpg " ")

4. In the Time period view, you can use the **calendar** to look at a specific time period in the past eight days. You can also use the **time slider** to change the period for which performance data is shown.

    ![](images/calendar-and-time-slider.jpg " ")

## Task 4: Monitor SQL Statements

1. Click the **Monitored SQL** tab to see information about current and past monitored SQL statements.

    ![](images/click-monitored-sql.jpg " ")

2. To see the detailed SQL Monitor report for a statement, select the statement and click **Show Details**. The **Overview** tab in the pop-up shows General information, Time and Wait Statistics, and IO Statistics for that statement.

    ![](images/click-show-details.jpg " ")

    ![](images/overview-tab-of-details-pop-up.jpg " ")

3. The **Metrics** tab in the pop-up shows CPU Used, Memory, IO Throughput, and IO Requests for that statement.

    ![](images/metrics-tab-of-details-pop-up.jpg " ")

## Task 5: Examine the OCI Monitoring Console

Another facility for monitoring your autonomous database is the OCI Monitoring Console.

1. Go back to the cloud services dashboard where you can see all the services available to you. Click the navigation menu in the upper left to show top level navigation choices.

    ![](images/click-navigation-menu.png " ")

2. Scroll down the navigation menu. Click **Observability & Management**, click **Service Metrics**.

    ![](images/click-service-metrics.png " ")

3. Choose a **Compartment** that you have permission to work in. Choose a **Metric Namespace** in the drop-down menu to the right of the compartment. If you're not sure which compartment and namespace to use, contact an administrator. Click the **edit** symbol next to **Dimensions**.

    ![](images/click-edit-dimensions-icon.png " ")

4. In the **Edit dimensions** pop-up dialog, select a **Deployment Type**. Click **Done**.

    ![](images/select-a-deployment-type.png " ")

5. The page updates to display only the resources in that compartment and namespace. Scroll down this very long page. It shows the following metrics:
    -   CPU Utilization
    -   Storage utilization
    -   Sessions
    -   Execute Count
    -   Running Statements
    -   Queued Statements
    -   Transaction Count
    -   Current Logons
    -   User Calls
    -   Parse Count
    -   Failed Logons
    -   Failed Connections
    -   Connection Latency
    -   Query Latency
    -   CPU Time

    ![](images/scroll-down-service-metrics-page.jpg " ")

6.  In addition to these service metrics, you can also perform queries on the metrics by using **Metrics Explorer**, creating **Alarms**, and creating **Health Checks**, to ensure that users will become immediately aware of any availability issues.

    ![](images/metrics-explorer-alarms-health-checks.jpg " ")

## Task 6: View Performance Data from the Performance Hub
You can view real-time and historical performance data from the Performance Hub. Performance Hub shows information about Active Session History (ASH) analytics and SQL monitoring.

1. In your ADW\_Finance|_Mart **Database Details** page, or from the **Database Actions Launchpad Monitoring** section, click **Performance Hub**.

    ![](images/click-performance-hub.png " ")

2. The Performance Hub page is displayed. This page has the following sections:
    -   The time selector.
    -   The Reports drop-down list, containing the option to create and download an AWR (Automatic Workload Repository) report.
    -   The tabbed data area, with the tabs ASH Analytics, SQL Monitoring, and Workload.

    ![](images/performance-hub-page.jpg " ")

3. The Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) collects, processes, and maintains performance statistics for problem detection and self-tuning purposes. This data is stored in both memory and the database. From the Performance Hub, you can generate and download a report of the gathered data.
From the **Reports** drop-down list, select **AWR**.

    ![](images/select-awr-from-reports-menu.jpg " ")

4. In the Generate AWR Report dialog, select the time range. You can either select **the two snapshots closest to** the current time, or you can create a **custom** time range. After you select the time range, click **Download**.

    ![](images/generate-awr-report.jpg " ")

5. Use the **Save As** dialog to specify where to download the report's HTML file to your local computer. Click the downloaded HTML file to view the lengthy, detailed report. The report is arranged with the following sections:
    - Report Summary
    - Time Model Statistics
    - Wait Events Statistics
    - Global Cache and Enqueue Statistics Summary
    - Global CR Server Statistics
    - Global Cache Transfer Statistics
    - SQL Statistics
